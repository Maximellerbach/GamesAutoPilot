# GamesAutoPilot
autopilot using my autonomous car CNN for games like Forza or trackmania

first in order to download the required packages: "pip install -r requirement.txt"

in order to use vjoy, you must install it:
http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php/download-a-install

and simply use pip to install pyvjoy:
"pip install pyvjoy"

to run the program, you must run "test.py" but before, you should change the path to your model (if you have one)
Anyway, one is provided as "model.h5


vJoy doesn't work with Forza, you can use the keyboard direction class but it's not that accurate, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a knowned work in progress
